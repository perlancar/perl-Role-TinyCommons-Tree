0.124   2020-04-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- NodeMethods: add descendants_depth_first().


0.123   2020-04-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [ux] Code::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods::_children_as_list: add
	  option $IGNORE_NO_CHILDREN_METHOD (and enable it by default) to
	  ignore instead of die when a node does not support method to get
	  children.


0.122   2020-02-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [bugfix] Downgrade requirements Class::InsideOut, Moo, Moose,
	  Tree::Object::Array::Glob from TestRequires to TestSuggests to
	  avoid circular dependency [RT#131944].

	- [test] Replace Test::Requires with Test::Needs (familiarity).


0.121   2020-02-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- NodeMethods: add check().


0.120   2020-02-06  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- NodeMethods: add remove().


0.11    2016-11-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Allow customizing get/set parent/children method names. This will add
	  some overhead for the indirection (i.e. from $node->parent or
	  $node->children(@foo) to $node->$GET_PARENT_METHOD or
	  $node->$SET_CHILDREN_METHOD(@foo)). The overhead is around 40ns on my
	  computer. Which should be worth it for the flexibility. In real-world
	  use (e.g. in Data::CSel) the overall overhead will be around 1% or
	  less.


0.10    2016-04-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add test with Class::InsideOut-based nodes.


0.09    2016-04-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Add ancestors().


0.08    2016-03-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Adjust tests for tree objects that do not accept setting
	  attributes in constructor, like Tree::Object::Array* (because
	  Class::Accessor::Array & Class::XSAccessor::Array do not).

	- Switch from Class::Build::Array::Glob to
	  Tree::Object::Array::Glob.


0.07    2016-03-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Make Tree::FromStruct role more generic (introduce _instantiate, work
          with non-hash-based objects).

        - Reorganize tests into a single test suite
          (Test::Role::TinyCommons::Tree).

        - Test the roles against hash-based class, Moose class, Moo class, and
          array-based class.


0.06    2016-03-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Handle case when children() returns (undef).


0.05    2016-03-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Add mentions in See Also.


0.04    2016-03-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Refactoring] Split routines in Role::TinyCommons::Tree::FromStruct to
          Code::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods so they can be used as normal sub
          call, like Code::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods.

        - Add tests for Code::Includable::Tree::{NodeMethods,FromStruct}.


0.03    2016-03-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Refactoring] Split node methods in to
          Code::Includable::Tree::NodeMethods for users that want to avoid
          loading Role::Tiny.

        - [doc] Add some more docs, including for the main module.


0.02    2016-03-21  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [Incompatible change] Rename dist from Role-TinyCommons-TreeNode to
          Role-TinyCommons-Tree. Rename role from Role::TinyCommons::TreeNode to
          Role::TinyCommons::Tree::Node.

        - Add role: Role::TinyCommons::Tree::NodeMethods.

        - Add role: Role::TinyCommons::Tree::FromStruct.


0.01    2016-03-19  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - First release.
